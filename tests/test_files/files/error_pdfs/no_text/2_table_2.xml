be rather simple things like the windows of a greenhouse opening 
automatically when it gets to warm, or a mist being sprayed when humi
gets too low, but also more complex things such as drones collecting field 
emergence data, or even machine learning being applied to seed sorting. So I

seeds are living things, and they have a tendency to act different than you 
would expect with the smallest changes. I can’t really give you an

automated systems as we talked about earlier are perhaps a decent example. 
You always have to find the optimum equilibrium for investment and return in 
any company, and the sam

you can bet that customers will favour their variety.
