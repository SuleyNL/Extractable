Calculations include energy use assumptions that are derived from various guidance documents, studies, or telemetry data. Assumptions on total lifetime expected use (years) are used. Sales geography for the products sold is used to determine the electricity emission factor used to calculate emissions. Emissions from third-party devices running Microsoft software are currently outside of the scope of our carbon commitments and therefore not included.
