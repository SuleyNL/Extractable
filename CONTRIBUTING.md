## Features
üöÄ Here are some of the key features of Extractable:

- **Table Extraction from PDFs**: Extractable utilizes machine learning models to extract tables from PDFs, simplifying data extraction from large datasets.

- **Open-Source and Collaborative**: We believe in community collaboration, and Extractable is an open-source project where your contributions are highly encouraged.

- **PDF Test Table Generator**: We've created a unique dataset to simulate real-world scenarios and evaluate machine learning models. Your input can help us enhance our testing scenarios.

- **Comparative Analyses**: We've conducted thorough comparative analyses of various machine learning models to determine their effectiveness in extracting tables from PDFs. Your insights could add to this valuable resource.

- **Robust Data Pipelines**: Our data pipelines are designed for processing and analyzing large volumes of PDF data while emphasizing code readability and sustainability.

## Installation
üõ†Ô∏è To get started with Extractable, simply install it using pip:

```bash
pip install Extractable
Extractable is designed for Python 3.10.
```

## Usage
üí° Using Extractable is straightforward. Import the library and use its functions as shown below:

```python
import extractable

input_file = "path_to/your_input.pdf"
output_file = "path_to/your_preferred_output"

# Extract tables from a PDF file
tables = extractable.Extractor.extract(input_file, output_file)

# It's that simple!
```

## Architecture
üèóÔ∏è To visualize the internal dependencies of this codebase, we utilize the 'Codesee' extension. With each pull request, a Codesee bot will analyze architecture changes, providing insightful visualizations. Here's a snapshot:

## Contributing Guidelines
ü§ù Extractable is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from all. If you're interested in contributing, please follow our contribution guidelines. Don't hesitate to reach out to us on our GitHub repository if you have any questions or need assistance.



### Issue Guidelines

üîç When creating an issue, please use the appropriate label to categorize it as one of the following:

- **Bug**: Something isn't working as expected.
- **Feature Request**: Proposing a new feature or enhancement.
- **Enhancement**: Suggesting improvements to existing features.
- **Documentation**: Issues related to documentation.
- **Help Wanted**: Indicating that the issue is suitable for contributors.

Provide a clear and detailed description of the issue you're facing or the feature you're suggesting. Include relevant context, error messages, and expected behavior.

If it's a bug, include steps to reproduce the issue. The more detailed and reproducible the steps, the easier it is to investigate and fix.

Mention the operating system, Python version, and any other relevant environment information. This helps in narrowing down the issue.



### Pull Request Guidelines

1. Create a new branch for your pull request with a descriptive name. Avoid working directly on the `main` branch.
2.  Follow the project's coding style and guidelines. Consistency is crucial for maintainability.
3.  Ensure that your code is adequately tested. New features or bug fixes should include appropriate unit tests.
4.  Update the documentation if your changes impact it. This includes README updates and docstrings in the code.
5.  Write clear and descriptive commit messages in the present tense. Each commit should address a single concern and be logically organized.
6.  Be open to feedback during code reviews and make necessary adjustments based on feedback from maintainers or contributors.



### Commit Guidelines

üöÄ Consider using conventional commit messages following a format like:

- ‚ú® `feat: add new feature`
- üêõ `fix: resolve a bug`
- üìñ `docs: update documentation`

This makes it easier to understand the purpose of each commit.

1. When a commit is related to a specific issue or feature request, reference it in the commit message, e.g., "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456."
2. Keep commits atomic, addressing a single change or concern. Avoid mixing unrelated changes in a single commit.
3. Before creating a pull request, merge your branch with the latest `main` to ensure it includes the most recent changes.

## Maintainers
Our maintainers oversee the development and management of Extractable. Here are the steps you might need as a maintainer:

### Testing
Before publishing a new version of Extractable, it's crucial to run tests to ensure the code's functionality remains intact. Follow these steps:

Run regression tests using the following command:
```bash
pdm run pytest -k "tests/ and Test_"
```

To test the library's functionality in a real-life scenario without uploading it to the official Pypi.org filesystem, follow these steps:
Build the distribution files:
```bash
pdm build
```

Push the library to the testing environment:
```bash
twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/extractable-[version]* --verbose
```

Install the testing library:
```bash
pip uninstall Extractable
python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple Extractable==[version]
```

### Publishing
When it's time to publish a new version of Extractable, follow these steps:

Update the version in `src/version.py` and the `pyproject.toml` file to the new version (old version +1).

Build the distribution files:

```bash
pdm build
```
Push the library to the real Pypi environment:

```bash
twine upload dist/extractable-[version]* --verbose
```
Install the updated library:

```bash
pip uninstall Extractable
python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple Extractable==[version]
```
